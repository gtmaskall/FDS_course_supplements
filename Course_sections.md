# Course sections

Here I'll try to provide resources under section headings that relate
to the Springboard curriculum units. Not all curriculum units will have
sections here. For example, "Getting started with the workshop" is
rather specific to Springboard. However, I can add some general
"getting started" resources.

## Getting started

The Springboard curriculum has an emphasis on introducing data science.
Here I'll add a couple of resources that introduce some data science
tools and advice on getting started studying.

[The data scientist's toolbox](
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/4mR4L/the-data-scientists-toolbox)
is a 5 minute video that introduces RStudio, .R files, and .Rmd files.
Pause it on slide 2! Read the bulleted list. Then read it again. When you've finished
reading it for the twentieth time, write them out. Return to this list periodically as
you work on your capstone project. Have you started to answer the question? Are you
progressing through the list?

And just to remind you, here is their list for

### What do data scientists do?

* Define the question
* Define the ideal data set
* Determine what data you can access
* Obtain the data
* Clean the data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Statistical prediction/modeling
* Interpret results
* Challenge results
* Synthesize/write up results
* Create reproducible code
* Distribute results to other people

Can you see how the list maps across to the Springboard curriculum?
Notice how we get you thinking about your capstone project right at the start.
Then the curriculum teaches you about cleaning data. You should be fairly happy
your data is not obviously broken in certain ways at this point! Then you can
proceed to doing some exploratory data analysis. Can you see any interesting trends?
Any information histograms of continuous variables? Any useful summary statistics such
as an average? At the end of this stage, you should have some firm things you want to
test or confirm and a solid grasp of the exact project question you intend to nail.
So then we cover some probability and statistics. Note, whether your project interest
is a predictive one or a statistical inference one, you may well want to skip ahead
to the start of unit 7 "An introduction to machine learning" which covers linear and
logistic regression. You can use a linear model either for prediction or for inference!
By now you should feel ready to tell your data story and you're close to being able to
complete. But we haven't finished JHU's list yet! Don't forget the important last
steps of interpreting and challenging your results. What do the coefficients or p-values
etc tell you? Was it what you expected? Does it makes sense? Then you bring this all
together into your report along with your reproducible code in your repository and
distribute it!

[Getting help](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/KPkZz/getting-help)
is an 8 minute video with much sound advice that maps well to the Springboard course.
And don't forget the [Springboard community](https://foundationsdscommunity.springboard.com/)!
Hint: if posting an R question to the community, have you watched the above video,
particularly slide 11? ;-)

[Finding answers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/6zxii/finding-answers)
is a 4 minute video that follow on from the previous one and also contains very good advice.
It's interesting to note the names used to refer to data science varying with application area.
It's very telling that a great course on data science is taught by people calling themselves
biostatisticians! You may already know that R tends to be the popular data science language
in the biological sciences and statistics.

## Start thinking about your capstone project

I'd already put together some guidance on finding your capstone project
[here](https://github.com/gtmaskall/Springboard_FDS_project_datasets)
and I hope it's useful. By all means use some of the specific datasets
listed there, but primarily I hope it gives you an idea of the sort
of characteristics to look for in your capstone project dataset.

## Programming in R

There are many resources available for learning R.

Probably the best advice I can give is to draw your attention to the following
steps:

1. Installing and getting started with RStudio
2. Installing and getting started with Git and Github
3. Getting started with R Markdown.

I heartily recommend you pause at this point and do not proceed any further until
you've got yourself established with these steps. Having these steps ticked off and
being comfortable with them will simplify both yours and your mentor's lives
considerably in the future, and will be valuable tools for your own future if you've
got a solid grasp of them.

Of the three, installing and getting started with RStudio is probably the easiest;
visit the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/) and click on the Download link
for RStudio and do the relevant stuff for your platform and follow the usual prompts
etc etc and you'll have RStudio up and running. NB I deliberately used a link to the
main RStudio page in the hope you notice the Shiny and R Packages sections. Remember them,
bookmark this page, and return to it in the future. Great stuff here!

The third step, getting started with R Markdown is probably the most neglected of the steps.
What is this R Markdown thing anyway? I'll come back to this. For now, step two,
installing and getting started with Git and Github has to be unarguably the biggest and
most common sticking point for students.

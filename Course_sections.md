# Course sections

Here I'll try to provide resources under section headings that relate
to the Springboard curriculum units. Not all curriculum units will have
sections here. For example, "Getting started with the workshop" is
rather specific to Springboard. However, I can add some general
"getting started" resources.

## Getting started

The Springboard curriculum has an emphasis on introducing data science.
Here I'll add a couple of resources that introduce some data science
tools and advice on getting started studying.

[The data scientist's toolbox](
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/4mR4L/the-data-scientists-toolbox)
is a 5 minute video that introduces RStudio, .R files, and .Rmd files.
Pause it on slide 2! Read the bulleted list. Then read it again. When you've finished
reading it for the twentieth time, write them out. Return to this list periodically as
you work on your capstone project. Have you started to answer the question? Are you
progressing through the list?

[Getting help](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/KPkZz/getting-help)
is an 8 minute video with much sound advice that maps well to the Springboard course.
And don't forget the [Springboard community](https://foundationsdscommunity.springboard.com/)!
Hint: if posting an R question to the community, have you watched the above video,
particularly slide 11? ;-)

## Start thinking about your capstone project

I'd already put together some guidance on finding your capstone project
[here](https://github.com/gtmaskall/Springboard_FDS_project_datasets)
and I hope it's useful. By all means use some of the specific datasets
listed there, but primarily I hope it gives you an idea of the sort
of characteristics to look for in your capstone project dataset.

## Programming in R

There are many resources available for learning R.

Probably the best advice I can give is to draw your attention to the following
steps:

1. Installing and getting started with RStudio
2. Installing and getting started with Git and Github
3. Getting started with R Markdown.

I heartily recommend you pause at this point and do not proceed any further until
you've got yourself established with these steps. Having these steps ticked off and
being comfortable with them will simplify both yours and your mentor's lives
considerably in the future, and will be valuable tools for your own future if you've
got a solid grasp of them.

Of the three, installing and getting started with RStudio is probably the easiest;
visit the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/) and click on the Download link
for RStudio and do the relevant stuff for your platform and follow the usual prompts
etc etc and you'll have RStudio up and running. NB I deliberately used a link to the
main RStudio page in the hope you notice the Shiny and R Packages sections. Remember them,
bookmark this page, and return to it in the future. Great stuff here!

The third step, getting started with R Markdown is probably the most neglected of the steps.
What is this R Markdown thing anyway? I'll come back to this. For now, step two,
installing and getting started with Git and Github has to be unarguably the biggest and
most common sticking point for students.

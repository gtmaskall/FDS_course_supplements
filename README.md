# Introduction

This repository contains supplementary information to help students
as they progress through Springboards Introduction to Data Science.
There is a lot of ground to cover and it's difficult covering a breadth
of material as well as providing sufficient technical depth at all times.
This resource was started particularly to try to ease certain pinch
points that students commonly encounter.

You may be thinking here that this is all just giving you more work to do.
You're absolutely right. No one said learning was easy. But these are all
entirely additional resources you can dip into as you like if you'd like
some additional information on particular points.

The curriculum is spanned by files that cover the logical sections:

## Getting started

This includes motivating material and introduction to key ideas and
workflows and, importantly tools. At the end you should be up and running
with RStudio, Git, and GitHub.

## Stages of data analysis

## Writing up
